Creating a code editor using the Piston API with a Chakra UI for the interface, alongside Monaco Editor for the editing component, involves integrating several technologies. Hereâ€™s how you can structure your README for the GitHub repository:

Piston API Code Editor
This project is a web-based code editor that interacts with the Piston API to execute code snippets in various programming languages. The user interface is built with Chakra UI, and the editor component utilizes Monaco Editor for a rich editing experience.

Features
Language Support: Execute code in multiple programming languages supported by the Piston API , such as php , c# , javascript , typescript .
Real-time Code Execution: Instantly see the output of your code snippets after running it by pressing run code.


Technologies I Used
React: Front-end framework for building the user interface.
Chakra UI: Component library for React, providing customizable UI components.
Monaco Editor: A browser-based code editor used in Visual Studio Code.
Piston API: Executes code in various programming languages.
